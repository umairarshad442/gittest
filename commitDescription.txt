i am trying to do it
Actually, you can do this quite easily from the command line. The trick is to type your message (without a closing quote!) and then hit enter twice, and then type your extended message, close the quote and press enter.

It should look like:

$ git commit -m "Make everything work.
dquote>
dquote> Add magic code that fixes everything"
